# Code Vault

## Instructions

This documentation will describe how different user roles can use Code Vault.

### General

In order to use Code Vault, you need to login to the system via a course
management system. When you launch Code Vault in the course management system,
Code Vault will automatically receive your identity and role (student, staff
member or teacher) in the course.

There is no need to create user accounts or define any roles manually in Code
Vault and that is not even possible.

Code Vault will use the language specified by the course management system or
its default language is the course management system does not inform about the
preferred language.
